## Vision

This project explores **synchronization as the hidden substrate of intelligence** — proposing that coherence, not computation, is the true organizing principle behind both artificial and biological cognition.  
It bridges **GPU architecture**, **cognitive science**, and **Daoist systems philosophy**, aiming to outline a new paradigm where timing, resonance, and harmony replace optimization as the foundations of intelligence.

---

## Research Directions

1. **Synchronization Entropy (𝒮)**  
   Develop quantitative metrics for temporal coherence across large-scale AI systems.

2. **Resonant Architectures**  
   Explore hardware and network designs that prioritize synchronization over throughput.

3. **Neural Phase-Locking and Collective Intelligence**  
   Investigate how biological synchrony (as in neural oscillations) parallels GPU timing coordination.

4. **Philosophical Foundations**  
   Integrate Daoist notions such as *wu wei* (action without domination) and *self-consistency* into system design ethics.
