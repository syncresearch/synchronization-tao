# Synchronization Entropy (𝓢) Project

### Abstract
Investigating synchronization entropy (𝓢) as a measurable indicator of coherence efficiency across large-scale distributed AI systems.

### Core Idea
Synchronization, not computation, defines stability.  
We aim to formalize 𝓢 — a metric quantifying timing coherence among GPU clusters and neural architectures.

### Research Path
1. **Definition:** Mathematical formulation of 𝓢 (see §3.1 of the paper)
2. **Simulation:** Implement 𝓢 tracking in large-scale training runs
3. **Hardware:** Test impact of interconnect topology (e.g. NVLink, InfiniBand)
4. **Analysis:** Correlate 𝓢 with performance, energy use, and emergent order

### Collaboration

- GPU systems engineering  
- Information physics  
- Complex systems theory
