# Synchronization Architecture Project (TaoSync)

### Abstract
Designing a hardware and systems architecture that prioritizes **temporal coherence** over raw throughput — a paradigm shift from optimization to synchronization.

### Concept
Modern AI hardware maximizes data flow and computational parallelism, yet overlooks phase alignment.  
The **TaoSync Architecture** proposes a system design that minimizes synchronization entropy (𝓢) through timing resonance across GPU clusters.

### Core Components
1. **Timing Layer:** Hardware-level synchronization fabric (beyond NVLink)  
   - Integrates clock phase feedback and coherence metrics.
2. **Resonance Bus:** A low-latency communication protocol supporting real-time phase correction.
3. **Self-Tuning Kernel:** Software kernel that dynamically adjusts execution based on 𝓢 feedback.
4. **Measurement Suite:** Real-time 𝓢 monitoring tools, correlating timing variance with energy and stability.

### Objectives
- Reduce synchronization entropy (𝓢) under high-load distributed training.  
- Enable **stable emergent coherence** across heterogeneous compute nodes.  
- Demonstrate measurable gain in stability-to-energy ratio.

### Collaboration
Seeking partners in:
- Hardware design (GPU/TPU architecture)
- Distributed systems engineering
- Signal synchronization and information physics
