# Synchronization-Tao

A conceptual and technical framework exploring **synchronization as the hidden substrate of intelligence** — bridging GPU architecture, cognitive science, and Daoist systems thinking.

---

## 📘 Abstract
This repository hosts the core paper *“Synchronization as the Hidden Substrate of Intelligence”* and its extended research trilogy.

It proposes that the next paradigm of AI will not be optimization, but **synchronization** — stability arising from timing coherence rather than algorithmic control.

## 🧩 The Synchronization Trilogy

| Layer | Title | Focus |
|-------|--------|--------|
| I | [S_entropy_project.md](S_entropy_project.md) | Measuring and minimizing synchronization entropy (𝓢) in large-scale GPU training |
| II | [S_architecture_design.md](S_architecture_design.md) | Designing TaoSync — hardware optimized for timing resonance |
| III | [S_participation_framework.md](S_participation_framework.md) | Reframing AI alignment as participatory synchronization |

## 🤝 Collaboration
We welcome physicists, system architects, and philosophers of mind to explore synchronization as a **unified principle** across computation and consciousness.
